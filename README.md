# Digital-Excellence
I've always felt like the internet and digital experiences were limited and non-intuitive.  So want to spark discussion and even make a plan for what it means to make the "perfect universal digital experience".  

## What's the point?

The point of this repo is to have a structured discussion.  I would like to eventually create a space where everyone who is interested in the topic can contribute and voice their ideas for what the right way to go about a big endevor like this.  I have my own ideas, but 1. I'm in no way a computer scientist, and 2. this is something I believe *requires* to be built by people, for people.

So let me ask you...

## What does this mean to you?

Making something both perfect and universal is innately immpossible, but looking what's been done today from the span of all of human exsistance, I'd say it impossible for people to never try.

So who are you?  What does a perfect ecosystem look like to you?  Are you a software designer?  Small business?  Teacher?  Rocket scientist?

I want to gather anyone and everyone who has a thought on the idea to develop something truly amazing and hasn't been done before!

## My Vision

When I ask myself the question of what this means, I attempted to break it down into its core components:

- OS
- Browser
- Microsoft 365-like apps (email, calendar, notes, etc.)
- Adobe-like app (Photoshop, Lightroom, Express, etc.)
- Automation, databases, and interfaces
- Learning/teaching app
- Social media (inspiring genuine interaction)
- IDE
- Media
- Music

I'm sure there are far more that I haven't even began to to touch the surface of, but thats why I want to do this!  The main goals are privacy, customization, and usablitlity.

Could you imagine?

Opening you computer to an OS that doesn't make you computer roar, customizing it to be uniquely yours with widgets and embedded links directly on your empty screen, being able to go from plan -> action without distraction or interruption from irrelevent apps, or complicated software design.  This is what I want.  And really, its what everyone (who uses a computer on a daily basis) wants.  So why isn't anyone trying to do something about it?

I believe it comes down to monitization, which is a factor, these tools aren't going to be done without money, but hey, I'm just a curious guy, so why not screw around with the idea?  If it becomes serious and people start planning, great!  But I don't expect this to happen right away, but I say why not try!  Everyone knows Google steals data yet we all use it because its the best option.  But people can change that!  

So let me know what you think.  Do you have any big ideas that have been burning a hole in your head that you can express?  I want to know!
